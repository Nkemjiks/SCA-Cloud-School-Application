# SCA-Cloud-School-Application
This is a docker technical assessment for SCA. I am using Ruby as my language. 
To test this assessment, simply follow the steps below:
* clone the repo and checkout to the `stable` branch.
* run `docker build -t sca-ruby-assessment .` to build the docker image.
* run `docker run sca-ruby-assessment` to test.

The last command should output `Welcome to SCA Cloud School Application , this is my first assessment`
